  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  <br />
  <p>"I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion about the means. 
    I think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." - Benjamin Franklin
  <br />
  <br />
    This best sums my intention for this website.  Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant in the homeless community.  This website is for homeless people and those living in poverty who will not squander the good intentions of others in order to feed their addictions.  
    While giving to those in need is good, resolving the issue entirely is the approach that I encourage people to take.  The goal of this
    operation is to permanently solve the issue of homelessness and poverty for those who truly hope and strive to better their life.
